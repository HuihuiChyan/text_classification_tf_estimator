forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary .
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review .
why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ?
let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears .
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .
contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
this thing is just garbage .

it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets .
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either .
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .
slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .
seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .

how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff .
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film .

the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) .
this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 .
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious .

a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .

our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it .
it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .
every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory .
an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title .

feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it .
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks .
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .
for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .
while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .

the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie—if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .

bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device .
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .

this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .

an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .

so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .
the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned .
a wordy wisp of a comedy .

a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken .
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .

a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .

mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring .

the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .

the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .
. . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school .
will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings .
equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .
unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .

this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .

the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care .
green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .

each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense .
the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
banal and predictable .
although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .

sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny .

even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .

too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script .
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny

the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher .
insufferably naive .
that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .

one long string of cliches .
a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .

flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams .
the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor .

given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube .
villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) .

unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 .
as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy .

a complete waste of time .
this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .

something must have been lost in the translation .
like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert .
belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating .
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .

diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .
. . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .
a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense .
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .
i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .

impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .

cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .

sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .
the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
